# Association UI

## Behavior

- The home UI no longer exposes an association form.
- The note page exposes an association form for linking other notes.
- Associations are still created via POST /associations for automation or tooling.
- next and prev are used to build recursive note chains on the note page.
- Association cards wrap text and use a multi-column grid layout on desktop.
