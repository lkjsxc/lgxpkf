# LGXPKF Documentation

This repository is documentation-first and structured as a recursive tree. Each directory contains a README.md that serves as the table of contents for that subtree.

## Project Stance

- Actix Web drives HTTP handling and routing.
- Frontend behavior is authored in TypeScript only; assets are built into static files.
- PostgreSQL is the single source of truth for persistent data.
